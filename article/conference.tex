	\section{AMCOS}
	
	The conference on Analysis and Modeling of Complex Oscillatory Systems (AMCOS) aims to bring together theoretical and experimental researchers working on the state of the art in the field of complex oscillatory systems.
	
	The main topics of the conference comprise both (a) the modeling of complex systems and the emergence of collective behavior, as well as (b) the analysis of complex data sets in order to infer the underlying structure and functionality of networks. Particular focus will be put on oscillatory phenomena in neuroscience.
	
	\section{COSMOS}
	
	The AMCOS Conference is organized by the Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) of the Marie Curie Initial Training Network led by Arkady Pikovsky of Potsdam Univeristy. COSMOS trains 15 ESRs at the interface between Physics, Applied Mathematics, and Life Sciences, integrating theoretical and data-driven methods, in 7 universities across Europe.

	{One of the most consistent global trends in science over the last decades concerns the move from individual efforts of scientists to collaborative projects among several researchers. Across most scientific disciplines the solitary researcher has been replaced by collective efforts between individuals often distributed across organizations and countries. Accompanying this trend are efforts to understand the “ingredients” of excellent research teams. Social sciences, but also social psychology as well as social networks analysis have all contributed to the understanding of successful collaborations. This contribution will review the elements of excellent teams as well as highlighting how bias and stereotypes can undermine optimal group performance. The presentation will be rounded up by examples how diversity not only affects research collaboration but also improves the quality of the produced science and engineering knowledge.} % Abstract text
